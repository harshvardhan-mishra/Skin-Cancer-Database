Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer. The main types of skin cancer are 
squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Melanoma is much 
less common than the other types but much more likely to invade nearby tissue and 
spread to other parts of the body. Most deaths from skin cancer are caused by 
melanoma. This database attempts to simplify the approach to look for various skin 
cancer causing protein and gene sequences.
